Created on a monday afternoon, including learning unity and getting used to C#. Due to further unfortunate circumstances, uploaded hastily and painfully via the web interface. Don't expect any quality to be present anywhere in this repository. It was fun.

Idea and music by Spargles. visual assets by Art Director Dave. Thanks!

Had a lot of pain with building for windows (10year+ old bug with resolutions..) and scaling things correctly. Only looks as it should in webgl build with correctly sized applet. Very satisfied with unity so far, like it. A part from that bug, which made me want to eat my keyboard. But felt better than godot, and is of course much heavier machinery than love2d.
